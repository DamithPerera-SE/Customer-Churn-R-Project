# Customer Churn Analysis & Prediction Using R

## Project Overview
This project analyzes customer churn data using R. It performs data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization, and builds a logistic regression model to predict churn. The insights help organizations reduce customer attrition and improve retention strategies.

## Skills Demonstrated
- Data Cleaning & Preprocessing  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Data Visualization using `ggplot2`  
- Logistic Regression Modeling  
- Business Insight Generation  

## Dataset
- `churn_data.csv` (sample data included)  
- Can be replaced with real-world telecom datasets for better analysis

### Sample Data Structure
| customer_id | age | monthly_charges | tenure | contract        | churn |
|-------------|-----|----------------|--------|----------------|-------|
| 1           | 25  | 45             | 6      | Month-to-month | Yes   |
| 2           | 45  | 80             | 24     | One year       | No    |

## How to Run
1. Install R and required libraries:
```r
install.packages(c("dplyr", "ggplot2"))
